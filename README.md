# Perfume Data Scraper

This project is a GUI-based application that scrapes perfume offer data from predefined URLs and displays it in a structured table format. Built using Python, it leverages web scraping and data handling libraries to fetch, parse, and display data, making it easy to view and analyze perfume offers.
